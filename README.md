# ESP8266_Thingspeak
To connect the ESP8266 12E to thingspeak and upload VOC sensor data.

TBD:
1. Add some code to upload at regular intervals, highest or lowest reading, depending on what you want. Run the sensor update inside loop rapidly, with no delay, and then use the value you need.
2. Check if interrupting WiFi affects data upload.
